# Notes for the Vehicle Routing Problem

## Wikipedia "[Vehicle Routing Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem)"
### Overview
The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a modern variant of the traveling salesman problem which is classified as a NP-hard problem. The vehicle routing problem asks how do we optimally route a vehicle to stop at multiple problems. Commercial solutions for this problem tend to be solved with heuristics because of the amount of VRP that the industry needs to solve and known solutions are exponential in nature. Solutions that bring efficiencies in this problem have a massive impact on the industry.
